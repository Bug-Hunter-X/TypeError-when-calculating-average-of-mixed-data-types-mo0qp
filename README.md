This repository demonstrates a common Python error: TypeError, which is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.  Specifically, this example shows how a TypeError can occur when calculating the average of a list containing both numbers and strings.  The solution showcases how to use error handling (try-except block) to prevent the program from crashing and handle this type of error gracefully.
